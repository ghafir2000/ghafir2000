👋 Hi, I’m Ahmad Al Ghafir, nice to meet you all! I’m currently learning, well, it's more like I am always learning.
still I am fortunate enough to have already earned my Automation Engineering Bachelor's degree. 

## Hobbies
I enjoy playing basketball, but what I would consider to be my favorite sport is definitely swimming since I am an excellent swimmer. Up for a race?? 😁😁

## Collaboration
I’m looking to collaborate on any AI-related project. I don't ask for much, since it's what I am passionate about.
I try to always keep up with the latest algorithms and models. If you're interested, you can check out my CV below.
